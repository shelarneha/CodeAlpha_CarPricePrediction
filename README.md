# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning 

## Internship
Data Science Internship – CodeAlpha

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of cars using machine learning techniques.
The prediction is based on various factors such as fuel type, transmission, year of purchase,
mileage, and other relevant features.

## Dataset
- File name: `car data.csv`
- Contains information about used cars and their selling prices
- Includes both numerical and categorical attributes

## Features Used
- Year
- Present Price
- Kms Driven
- Fuel Type
- Selling Type
- Transmission
- Owner

## Target Variable
- Selling Price

## Machine Learning Algorithm
- **Linear Regression**

Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between car features and the selling price.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Preprocessed data and encoded categorical variables
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated model performance

## Model Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squ
